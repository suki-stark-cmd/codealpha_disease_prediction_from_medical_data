Disease Prediction from Medical Data
Welcome to the Disease Prediction from Medical Data repository! This project was completed during my CodeAlpha internship and focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict heart disease based on various health metrics. The goal of this project is to assist in the early detection of heart disease, enabling healthcare providers to make more informed decisions and potentially improve patient outcomes.

Project Overview:
The Disease Prediction from Medical Data project uses a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, age, and other key health indicators. By analyzing these health metrics, the model can provide valuable insights for early diagnosis and guide recommendations for treatment or preventive care. The ability to predict heart disease at an early stage can lead to better management of patients' health and help in proactive healthcare planning.

This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete implementation of the project, including:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Model Training: Training machine learning models (such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests) to predict heart disease.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the prediction quality.
heart.csv:
This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the disease prediction model. The dataset includes medical features such as:

Age: The patient's age.
Sex: The gender of the patient.
Blood Pressure: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure values.
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol levels.
ECG results: Electrocardiogram (ECG) results.
Other health indicators: Various other health metrics that contribute to heart disease prediction.
